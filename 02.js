//1. Console log a line of text eg. "this is an exercise in console logging" (do not forget quotation marks).
console.log("this is an exercise in console logging");

//2. Declare a variable and give your variable the following value: "This is the value.". Console log your **variable**. 
var aString="This is the value";
console.log(aString);

//3. Declare a variable called firstName and assign your first name to that variable. Do the same with your last name. Console log both variables. NOTE: When console logging two variables, separate the variables with a comma (,) in the console log e.g. console.log(variable1, variable2);
var firstName="Shih-chen";
var lastName="Chao";
console.log(firstName, lastName);

//4. Make a profile of someone's information. Store all the information in variables eg. name, city, job etc. (five variables total) Console log the variables. 
var firstName="Edward";
var lastName="Sanders";
var location="Hundred Acre Woods";
var job="Bear";
var features="Honey eater and deep thinker";
console.log(firstName, lastName, location, job, features);

//5. Print a sentence using the profile variables above, adding text where necessary for sentence flow, i.e., "John Smith is a 43 year old teacher who lives in Berlin". **you can combine variables with text in the console by using the plus symbol (+) e.g. console.log("this is a " + variable);**
console.log("We are meeting", firstName, lastName+", who lives in", location,".", "He works as a", job+". His features are being a", features+".");
